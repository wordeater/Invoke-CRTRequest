- Fix the output such that `-Verbose` doesn't break the ability to write to a CSV. It seems to be inconsistent.
- Find a reliable way to write all output to the same log file being used by the code calling the function. Currently Tee-Object doesn't seem to catch all the function output. It writes to screen, but not to file.
- Look. I know sending the outoput as a `system.array` is a bad idea and it should really be a `PSCustomObject` but I'm still working on that.
