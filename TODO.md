- Fix the script such that `-Verbose` **never** breaks the ability to write to a CSV. It seems to be inconsistent.
- I'd love the final output to be a single nested `PSObject` instead of a `system.array` of `PSObject` objects, but I haven't figured that out.
- **[DONE IN 1.6]** I'm using the dreaded `Write-Host` for some output that I want the user to see but that does not need to be part of the final output object. I like to log everything. I log all the output of all of my scripts using `Tee-Output`. Regular old `Write-Output` seems to write to the `tee` object but also to `STDOUT` and the output object. I'd love to have a better way to this. I'd love to have a way to `Write-Output` but **only** have it write to the `STDOUT` and the `tee` objec tlog file and **not** write to the output object. For now, this abominable combination of `Write-Output`, `Write-Host`, `Tee-Output`, `Write-Warning`, `Write-Verbose` kind of works.
